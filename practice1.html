        <p><br>Here is info from wikipedia on the norse god Thor: Thor (from Old Norse: Þórr) 
            is a prominent god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, 
            he is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, 
            storms, strength, protection, fertility, farmers, and free people.[1][2] 
            Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old English as Thunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, 
            in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic 
            theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.
